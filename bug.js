This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common in asynchronous operations, where the state update might not have completed yet. In React Native, this frequently happens with data fetching from APIs or other asynchronous tasks.  For example:

```javascript
//Incorrect Code
const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.example.com/user')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => setUserData(data));
}, []);

return (
  <View>
    <Text>{userData.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
  </View>
);
```

Accessing `userData.name` immediately after fetching may lead to an error because `setUserData` is asynchronous; the state may still be `null` when the component renders.
